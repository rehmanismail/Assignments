//Number Guess Game
// This guess the number game is a short TypeScript/Node.js project that allows the user to guess 
// the number generated by the computer. There are also several ways to alter the game, like adding 
// more rounds or displaying the score. Itâ€™s quite simple and uses the random function to generate a number.
